                    Knowledge has played a foundational role in Artificial Intelligence since its inception. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, the demands on how knowledge is captured, represented, and operationalized have become more complex. Today’s breakthroughs—particularly in large language models and neuro-symbolic architectures—highlight the importance of moving beyond data volume toward precise, efficient, and meaningful knowledge representations.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    K-CAP 2025 continues its tradition of convening an interdisciplinary community committed to advancing the science and engineering of knowledge capture. From structured semantics and multimodal fusion to learning-based extraction and human-in-the-loop systems, K-CAP offers a forum for exploring rigorous, creative, and scalable approaches to modeling and applying knowledge.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    In a world increasingly driven by diverse, distributed data—from text and tables to images, video, and user interactions—this year’s conference emphasizes interpretability, compositionality, and reuse as key pillars of knowledge-centric AI. New to K-CAP 2025 is a strategic alignment with FAIR principles, promoting structured sharing of datasets, tools, ontologies, and methods to enhance transparency, reproducibility, and community impact. </p>
                  <p class="text-justify"> 
                    The conference will feature a rich program of keynote speakers, tutorials, and workshops, alongside a vibrant poster and demo session. We invite researchers and practitioners from a wide range of fields—including knowledge representation, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and ethics in AI—to share their insights and innovations. K-CAP 2025 is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that encourages collaboration and the exchange of ideas across disciplines. </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    K-CAP 2025 invites participation from across AI research areas, including but not limited to: Knowledge representation and acquisition, Ethics and trust in knowledge-centric systems, Explainability and knowledge-driven interpretability, Interactive and intelligent user interfaces, Querying and reasoning over heterogeneous knowledge bases, Evaluation methodologies for knowledge systems, Neuro-symbolic and hybrid AI approaches, Compact models: constraint networks, graphical models, Knowledge in multi-agent and planning systems, Information and metadata extraction, Multimodal knowledge capture (text, images, tables, audio, video), Knowledge graph construction from language models, Structured knowledge extraction from LLMs, Deep learning for representation and reasoning, Representation learning from structured/unstructured data. </p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    We look forward to welcoming you to K-CAP 2025—where symbolic and neural, theoretical and applied, human and machine perspectives converge to push the boundaries of knowledge capture.</p>


                  <!-- Knowledge has played a fundamental role since the inception of artificial intelligence. While the forms in which algorithms have leveraged knowledge have evolved over time, the need for efficient representations is ever more critical. Indeed, recent advances of AI, such as the stunning performance of large language models&nbsp; have relied on the large amount of data available on the Web. There is growing agreement among researchers that it's important to look beyond the sheer volume of data, and instead also prioritize the development of methods that are accurate, precise, and efficient for capturing knowledge.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">
                    The International Conference on Knowledge Capture, K-CAP, aims at bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers on a diverse set of topics with interest in the development of knowledge capture. This involves the design and development of formalisms, methods and tools that enable efficient and precise extraction and organization of knowledge from different sources and for different modalities of use including, for example, automated reasoning, machine learning and human-machine teaming.
                  <p>

                  <p class="text-justify">To enable a vibrant and constructive discussion on scalable and precise knowledge capture, K-CAP 2023, calls for the participation of researchers from diverse areas of artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge acquisition, semantic web, intelligent user interfaces for knowledge acquisition and retrieval, query processing and question answering over heterogeneous knowledge bases, novel evaluation paradigms, problem-solving and reasoning, ethics and AI, explainability, neurosymbolic AI, agents, information extraction from structured or unstructured data, machine learning and representation learning, information enrichment and visualization, as well as researchers interested in cyber-infrastructures to foster the publication, retrieval, reuse, and integration of data.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">K-CAP is an in-person conference, and remote participation will not be supported.&nbsp;</p>
