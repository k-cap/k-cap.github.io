						<h6>Title: MOMo's Journey: Addressing Knowledge Acquisition</h6>

						<h6>Abstract</h6>
                        
						<p class="text-justify">MOMo - Modular Ontology Modeling - is an ontology (and by extension: knowledge graph) design methodology that incorporates as important principles a wide range of methods that have evolved out of a quarter century of Semantic Web research. This includes strong axiomatization with formal logic, design patterns, modularity, capturing of human conceptualizations, visual collaborative modeling in a diverse team, vocabulary and documentation guidelines, etc. In addition, from its inception MOMo was designed to be a Knowledge Graph and Ontology Engineering approach that is amenable for partial automation. In this presentation, we will talk about the principles that lead to MOMo and are incorporated in it, as well as recent progress regarding the use of LLMs for assisting in Knowledge Graph and Ontology Engineering.</p>

						<h6>Title: Justified Confidence in highly-consequential AI: Assuring AI-Enabled Systems for the Department of Defense </h6>
						<h6>Abstract: </h6>
						<p>As the implementation and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continues to expand within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the critical need for AI Assurance becomes increasingly apparent. Successful integration of AI into defense operations demands robust mechanisms to measure and ensure effectiveness, reliability, security, and ethical use of these advanced systems. This talk delves into the multifaceted challenges of AI Assurance within the DoD, addressing key aspects such as algorithmic transparency, accountability, and the mitigation of potential risks. By examining best practices, emerging technologies, and policy frameworks, this presentation aims to shed light on the strategic imperatives required to build a resilient AI ecosystem that supports the DoD's mission while maintaining integrity in the application of AI.&nbsp;</p>

						<p class="text-justify">
							Dr. Jane Pinelis currently serves as the Chief AI Engineer of the Applied Information Sciences Branch at Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). She leads a diverse team of testers and analysts in rigorous test and evaluation (T&amp;E) for JAIC capabilities, as well as the development of T&amp;E-specific products and standards that will support testing of AI-enabled systems across the DoD.</p>
							<p>Dr. Pinelis holds a BS in statistics, economics, and mathematics, an MA in statistics, and a Ph.D. in statistics, all from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. With a background in defense and national security spanning over 15 years, Dr. Pinelis has held a variety of key positions of responsibility. Prior to her current role, she served as the inaugural Chief of AI Assurance at the Chief, Digital and AI Office (CDAO) and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) at the Department of Defense, where she oversaw the Test and Evaluation, as well as Responsible AI directorates.</p>
							<p>Her career has largely focused on operational test and evaluation, both in support of the service operational testing commands and at the OSD level; her leadership roles included managing the Test Science team that supports the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), and leading the design and analysis of the highly-publicized study on the effects of integrating women into combat roles in the Marine Corps during her assignment at the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity.</p>
