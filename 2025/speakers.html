							<h6>Title: MOMo's Journey: Addressing Knowledge Acquisition</h6>
	
							<h6>Abstract</h6>
							<p class="text-justify">
								MOMo - Modular Ontology Modeling - is an ontology (and by extension: knowledge graph) design methodology that incorporates as important principles a wide range of methods that have evolved out of a quarter century of Semantic Web research. This includes strong axiomatization with formal logic, design patterns, modularity, capturing of human conceptualizations, visual collaborative modeling in a diverse team, vocabulary and documentation guidelines, etc. In addition, from its inception MOMo was designed to be a Knowledge Graph and Ontology Engineering approach that is amenable for partial automation. In this presentation, we will talk about the principles that lead to MOMo and are incorporated in it, as well as recent progress regarding the use of LLMs for assisting in Knowledge Graph and Ontology Engineering.

								Pascal Hitzler is University Distinguished Professor and endowed Lloyd T. Smith Creativity in Engineering Chair at the Department of Computer Science at Kansas State University, one of the Directors of the Institute for Digital Agriculture and Advanced Analytics (ID3A), and Director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CAIDS) Until July 2019 he was endowed NCR Distinguished Professor, Brage Golding Distinguished Professor of Research, and Director of Data Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A. He is director of the Data Semantics (DaSe) Lab. From 2004 to 2009, he was Akademischer Rat at the Institute for Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany, and from 2001 to 2004 he was postdoctoral researcher at the Artificial Intelligence institute at TU Dresden in Germany. In 2001 he obtained a PhD in Mathematics from the National University of Ireland, University College Cork, and in 1998 a Diplom (Master equivalent) in Mathematics from the University of Tübingen in Germany. His research record lists over 400 publications in such diverse areas as neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence, semantic web, knowledge graphs, knowledge representation and reasoning, denotational semantics, and set-theoretic topology. His research is highly cited. He was founding Editor-in-chief of the Semantic Web journal, the leading journal in the field, and is founding Editor-in-chief of the new Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence journal, and of the IOS Press book series Studies on the Semantic Web. He is co-author of the W3C Recommendation OWL 2 Primer, and of the book Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies by CRC Press, 2010, which was named as one out of seven Outstanding Academic Titles 2010 in Information and Computer Science by the American Library Association's Choice Magazine, and has translations into German and Chinese. He is on the editorial board of several journals and book series and a founding steering committee member of the Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Association and the Association for Ontology Design and Patterns, and he frequently acts as conference chair in various functions.

							<h6>Bio</h6>
							<p class="text-justify">
							Paul Groth is Professor of Algorithmic Data Science at the University of Amsterdam where he leads the Intelligent Data Engineering Lab (INDElab) and is scientific director of the UvA’s Data Science Center. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southampton (2007) and has done research at the University of Southern California, the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Elsevier Labs. His research focuses on intelligent systems for dealing with large amounts of diverse contextualized data with a particular focus on web and science applications. This includes research in data provenance, data integration and knowledge sharing.
							</p>
							<p class="text-justify">
							Previously, Paul led the design of a number of large scale data integration and knowledge graph construction efforts in the biomedical domain. Paul was co-chair of the W3C Provenance Working Group that created a standard for data provenance interchange. He has also contributed to the emergence of community initiatives to build a better scholarly data ecosystem including altmetrics and the FAIR data principles.
							</p>
							<p class="text-justify">
							Paul is co-author of “Provenance: an Introduction to PROV” and “The Semantic Web Primer: 3rd Edition” as well as numerous academic articles. You can find him on twitter: @pgroth .
