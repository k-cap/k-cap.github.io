<h2>Business Visitor Visas (B-1)</h2>

<p>Many attendees from outside the US will require a B-1 Visitor Visa to enter the United States. Consult the U.S. Department of State for <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english.html" target="_blank">details on visa requirements</a> 
</p>

<p>If you're coming from one of the 38 countries in the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/visit/visa-waiver-program.html" target="_blank">Visa Waiver Program</a>, you do not require a visa, but you must still register with the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/esta" target="_blank">Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)</a> and possess an e-passport. Some people with older pre-e-passports have found that it is easier to get a new passport than to apply for a visa.</p>

<p>Most visa applications require an interview. The wait time to receive an interview appointment at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate could be over 16 days. Please see the U.S. Department of State's <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/wait-times.html" target="_blank">page for estimates of visa and processing wait time</a> at different consulates. Please schedule your appointment as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Visa Invitation Letters</h3>

<p>If you require a letter of invitation for a B-1 Visitor Visa, please send your request to visa@k-cap2015.org as soon as possible, specifying the information you require in your letter (full name, country of citizenship, date of birth, place of birth, passport number and expiration date, employer).</p>
