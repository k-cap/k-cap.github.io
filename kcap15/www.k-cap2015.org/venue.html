	<h2>Venue</h2>

	<p>This year's K-CAP conference will be held at the <a href="http://www.dolcepalisades.com/" target="_blank">Dolce Palisades Hotel and Conference Center</a>, just outside New York City. The Dolce Palisades is within 30 miles of the NYC airports: John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA), Newark (EWR) and Westchester (HPN). The venue is minutes by car to Tarrytown Station, with service to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.</p>

	<p>K-CAP 2015 is also conveniently close in time and space to this year's <a href="http://iswc2015.semanticweb.org/" target="_blank">International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2015)</a> at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Although the two conferences are not quite "co-located", those at K-CAP 2015 can easily attend the last K-CAP plenary session, have their free K-CAP lunch and make it to Bethlehem to check in prior to the first day of ISWC activities.</p>
