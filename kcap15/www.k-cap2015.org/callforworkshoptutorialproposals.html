	<h2>Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals</h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>The International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP) provides a forum that brings together members of diverse research communities who are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a vast range of sources, including human sources (such as experts, crowds and social contexts), and in creating representations that can be useful for building knowledge-intensive services in a variety of fields, such as the semantic web, knowledge management, e-business, natural language processing, intelligent information integration, and so on. </p>

	<p>The 8th edition of K-CAP will host a number of workshops and tutorials on topics related to the theme of the conference. </p>

	<p>K-CAP workshops provide an informal setting where participants have the opportunity to discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active exchange of ideas. Our aim for the workshop program is to promote and collect multidisciplinary research directions that contribute to knowledge capture from a variety of sources.</p>

	<p>K-CAP tutorials enable attendees to fully appreciate current issues, main schools of thought, and possible application areas.</p>
