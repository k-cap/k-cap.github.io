<i>Talk title: </i> <br>
<i> "Knowledge Capture through the Millennia: From Cuneiform to the Semantic Web" </i> <br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
As we celebrate 25 years of knowledge capture research we can view it from a short-term perspective as a substantial component of the 60-year development of digital computing technologies, and from a long-term perspective as the most very recent segment of the twelve millennia evolution of recorded knowledge processes that have shaped our civilization. We can trace the development of knowledge capture processes similar to those we now study: from the Neolithic origins of our civilization in the Levant; through the Babylonian development of mathematics and writing; Greek innovations in logic, ontology and science, and their medieval elaboration; the development of formal logics, metaphysical systems and sciences stemming from the scientific revolution; to the computational implementation of knowledge representation, capture, inference and their ubiquitous application in our current information age. This presentation outlines major events in the trajectory of knowledge capture processes over the millennia, focusing on those relevant to where we are now and where we may be going. It segues through: broad models of the evolution of civilization from archeological, economic, socio- cultural and systemic perspectives; highlights in the formalization of knowledge capture processes through the ages; trajectories in the development of knowledge technologies supporting its representation, capture and application; to projections of expected major issues and advances in the next quarter century.

<i> "Has 'Knowledge' been the driver?" </i> <br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk I will review the impact of 25 years of research (which
started as "Knowledge Acquisition") on society and industry, especially
from a European perspective. I will also revisit the value of knowledge
versus data and how that has evolved in the last 25 years.

<b> Dr. James Fan, IBM </b><br>
<i>Tentative title: </i> <br>
<i> "Building Watson – A Brief Overview of DeepQA and the Jeopardy! Challenge" </i> <br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
A computer system that can answer natural language questions over a broad range of knowledge with high accuracy and confidence has been envisioned by scientists and writers since the advent of computers themselves. Consider, for example, the "Computer" in Star Trek. The DeepQA project at IBM aims to take on this grand challenge by illustrating how the wide and growing accessibility of natural language content and the integration and advancement of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and massively parallel computation can drive open-domain automatic Question Answering technology to a point where it clearly and consistently rivals the best human performance. 
   In this talk, we will give an overview of the DeepQA technology and describe how it was used to build Watson, the computer system that won the Jeopardy Man vs. Machine challenge in February 2011. Watson's ability to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data has the potential to transform business intelligence, healthcare, customer support, enterprise knowledge management, social computing, science and government.

His research interests include question answering, knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing and machine learning. James is currently working on the DeepQA project which is advancing the state-of-the-art in automatic, open domain question answering technology. The DeepQA team is pushing question answering technology to levels of performance previously unseen and demonstrate the technology by playing Jeopardy! at the level of a human champion.
James has been working in the area of question answering since 2003, and has published on subjects in knowledge representation, reasoning, natural language processing and machine learning in leading AI journals and conferences.

<b> Dr. Tom Gruber, Co-founder and CTO of Siri </b><br>
<i>Title: </i> <br>
<i>"Design for Intelligence: AI and UI and the Intelligent User"</i> <br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
We can build magnificent machines to search the world's knowledge, play world class chess, win at games shows, and other noble feats of intelligence. But the technology at the interface -- which we all use, every day, all day long -- is still about as smart as a typewriter. This doesn't have to be. We can put intelligence at the interface, treating the human-computer interaction as a domain of expertise. We can build magnificent interfaces to apply the world's knowledge, operate our devices, and mediate our conversations. Call it Design for Intelligence - at the interface. This talk is a retrospective of attempts to put intelligence at the interface, through design and technology. We will follow a connection thread from communication prosthesis to knowledge acquisition to collaborative knowledge sharing to collective knowledge systems to virtual assistants. We will look for sources of success and failure. And we will have fun.

<b> Dr. Bill Swartout, Director of Technology for USC's Institute for Creative Technologies </b><br>
<i>Title: </i> <br>
<i>"Let Me Tell You a Story…."</i> <br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
Stories are a fundamental means through which we learn and share experiences.  At the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, stories are the backbone behind a wide variety of simulated experiences that we create to educate and train skills in leadership, negotiation, cultural awareness and negotiation.  These experiences range from filmed dramatizations of case studies to fully interactive experiences with virtual humans set in virtual worlds.  But authoring these stories and constructing the knowledge structures, such as language and dialogue models, needed to support their use in our simulations is a highly labor intensive task.  Additionally, it is important to ensure that the stories are authentic and reflect current realities, which may require access to outside subject matter experts if the stories are developed in-house.    In this talk I will present work we have been pursuing at the ICT to use data-driven methods to gather stories from the web and other sources and incorporate them into simulations.  This work consists of several efforts which taken together, hold the promise of providing more authentic experiences while at the same time reducing the modeling and knowledge base construction effort required to support them.
