				          <h5><a href="https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/ormekr2023/ ">Ordinal Methods for Knowledge Representation and Capture (OrMeKR)</a></h5>
<p>Organizers: Tom Hanika, Dominik DÃ¼rrschnabel, Johannes Hirth&nbsp;</p>
						  <p>Duration: Half-day&nbsp;</p>
						  <p>The concept of order (i.e., partial ordered sets) is predominant for perceiving and organizing our physical and social environment, for inferring meaning and explanation from observation, and for searching and rectifying decisions. Compared to metric methods, however, the number of (purely) ordinal methods for capturing knowledge from data is rather small, although in principle they may allow for more comprehensible explanations. The reason for this could be the limited availability of computing resources in the last century, which would have been required for (purely) ordinal computations. Hence, typically relational and especially ordinal data are first embedded in metric spaces for learning. Therefore, in this workshop we want to collect and discuss ordinal methods for capturing and representing knowledge, their role in inference and explainability, and their possibilities for knowledge visualization and communication. We want to reflect on these topics in a broad sense, i.e., as a tool to arrange, compare and compute ontologies or concept hierarchies, as a feature in learning and capturing knowledge, and as a performance measure to evaluate model performance. </p>
						  <h5><a href="https://kgsum.github.io/2023">International Workshop on Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum)</a></h5>
                          <p>Organizers: Carlos Badenes-Olmedo, Jose Luis Redondo-Garcia, Nandana Mihindukolasoriya, Maribel Acosta&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Duration: Half-day&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>In recent years, there is an increasing interest in being able to programmatically generate summaries from the facts contained in a knowledge graph (KG). Condensing relevant information into a few sentences, paragraphs or triples is an emerging problem that remains to be solved as knowledge bases increase in complexity and expand in size and domains. Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum) aims at producing concise but informative descriptions of entities from knowledge graphs that help users to efficiently access and distill valuable information from it. Conversational systems, question-answering services or any other method leveraging the narrative content around the entities in a knowledge graph will benefit from these techniques. This workshop welcomes a wide range of papers, including full research papers, position papers, datasets, prototypes or negative results, which explore a variety of issues and processes related to the creation of summaries from KGs such as question-answering, graph-to-text transformations, and entity summarization, among others.</p>
