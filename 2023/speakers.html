								    Capturing Knowledge for XAI</p>

									<h6>Abstract</h6>

						<p class="text-justify">Spanning the early 1980s to the present, work on the notion of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) revealed many requirements and challenges that are manifest today in the topic of Explainable AI.  Also spanning those decades was the work on knowledge capture for Expert Systems. There too, many requirements and challenges were revealed that are manifest today in Explainable AI. The nexus formed by these endeavors is the following: An XAI system is a form of ITS, but the thing being explained is the AI itself. An XAI system must have within it a model of the knowledge of the user, and also model of the pedagogical process. Clarity about the challenges arises from a consideration the of cognitive processes involved in how people explain and try to make sense of complex systems. Clarity about system requirements arises from a re-consideration of how large-scale AI research programs are conceived and designed. This presentation will focus on a set of Principles of Explanation that are specific to XAI, and a set of general Policy Recommendations that pertain to all research that is intended to evaluate the performance of Human-AI work systems.</p>
