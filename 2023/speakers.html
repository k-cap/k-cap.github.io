						<h6>Title: Old Lessons Uncovered, New Lessons Discovered: Capturing Knowledge for XAI</h6>

						<h6>Abstract</h6>

						<p class="text-justify">Spanning the early 1980s to the present, work on the notion of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) revealed many requirements and challenges that are manifest today in the topic of Explainable AI.  Also spanning those decades was the work on knowledge capture for Expert Systems. There too, many requirements and challenges were revealed that are manifest today in Explainable AI. The nexus formed by these endeavors is the following: An XAI system is a form of ITS, but the thing being explained is the AI itself. An XAI system must have within it a model of the knowledge of the user, and also model of the pedagogical process. Clarity about the challenges arises from a consideration the of cognitive processes involved in how people explain and try to make sense of complex systems. Clarity about system requirements arises from a re-consideration of how large-scale AI research programs are conceived and designed. This presentation will focus on a set of Principles of Explanation that are specific to XAI, and a set of general Policy Recommendations that pertain to all research that is intended to evaluate the performance of Human-AI work systems.</p>

					<h3>Dr. Jane Pinelis<h3>
						<h5>Chief AI Engineer of the Applied Information Sciences Branch at JHU/APL</h5>
						<h6>Title: to be announced </h6>
						<h6>Abstract: to be announced</h6>
						<h6>Bio</h6>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Dr. Jane Pinelis currently serves as the Chief AI Engineer of the Applied Information Sciences Branch at Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). She leads a diverse team of testers and analysts in rigorous test and evaluation (T&amp;E) for JAIC capabilities, as well as the development of T&amp;E-specific products and standards that will support testing of AI-enabled systems across the DoD.</p>
							<p>Dr. Pinelis holds a BS in statistics, economics, and mathematics, an MA in statistics, and a Ph.D. in statistics, all from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. With a background in defense and national security spanning over 15 years, Dr. Pinelis has held a variety of key positions of responsibility. Prior to her current role, she served as the inaugural Chief of AI Assurance at the Chief, Digital and AI Office (CDAO) and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) at the Department of Defense, where she oversaw the Test and Evaluation, as well as Responsible AI directorates.</p>
							<p>Her career has largely focused on operational test and evaluation, both in support of the service operational testing commands and at the OSD level; her leadership roles included managing the Test Science team that supports the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), and leading the design and analysis of the highly-publicized study on the effects of integrating women into combat roles in the Marine Corps during her assignment at the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity.</p>
