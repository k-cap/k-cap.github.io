<p>SIGAI accepted a <a href="http://sigai.acm.org/static/pdf/K-Cap-Governance-Aug2013.pdf">governance proposal</a> submitted jointly by the chairs of recent K-CAP conferences. The proposal includes a provision to jumpstart the process with a Founding Steering Committee, whose members are the chairs of the last four K-CAP conferences.  The Founding Steering Committee will advertise to SIGAI members and to the broader K-CAP community an announcement for elections for a Steering Committee.</p>
