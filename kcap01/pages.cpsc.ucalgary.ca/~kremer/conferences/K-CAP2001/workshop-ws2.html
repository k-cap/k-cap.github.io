<h3>Call for Participation K-CAP 2001 Workshop Knowledge in E-Business</h3>

<h2>Workshop Topic:  Knowledge in e-Business</h2>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>The aim of this half-day workshop is to bring together scientists and
practitioners interested in knowledge-oriented approaches relevant to
electronic business. E-business raises interesting new challenges and issues
from a knowledge point of view. Many actors – humans, agents, systems – with
different knowledge backgrounds and levels interact dynamically. Many
multi-disciplinary aspects, including economy, business operations, and
technology systems, have to be handled simultaneously and must be
integrated. It is a good time now to consider what knowledge acquisition,
modeling, and management can contribute to the explosively growing field of
e-business. The format of the workshop will be brief presentations of the
key messages of submitted papers, followed by extensive discussion. We also
plan to reserve some time to discuss a future research agenda:  what are the
fruitful research topics and needs for the K-CAP community in matters of
electronic business?
