K-CAP'2001: Preliminary Announcement and Call for Papers</h2></center>
In today's web-linked and data-rich world, there is a growing need to effectively
manage large amounts of information. Although indexing and linking documents
and other information sources is an important step, capturing the knowledge
contained within these sources is crucial for the effective use of large
information repositories. Knowledge acquisition has been a challenging
area of artificial intelligence research, with its roots in early expert
systems work. Driven by today's internet culture and knowledge-based industries,
the study of knowledge acquisition has a renewed value.
<p>Although there has been considerable work in this topic, it has been
distributed across several distinct research communities. In machine learning,
learning apprentices acquire knowledge by non-intrusively watching a user
perform a task. In the human-computer interfaces community, programming-by-demonstration
systems learn to perform a task by watching a user demonstrate how to accomplish
it. In knowledge engineering, modeling techniques and design principles
have been proposed for knowledge-based systems, often exploiting commonly
occurring domain-independent inference structures and ontologies. In planning
and process management, mixed-initiative systems acquire knowledge about
a user&sup1;s goals by taking commands or advice regarding a task. In natural
language processing, tools can process text and create representations
of its knowledge content. All of these approaches are related in that they
acquire information and organize it in knowledge structures that can be
used for reasoning. They are complementary in that they use different techniques
and approaches to capture different forms of knowledge.
<p>The aim of this conference is to provide a forum to bring together these
disparate research communities interested in efficiently capturing knowledge
from a variety of sources into representations that can be (or can eventually
be) useful for reasoning. This conference will foster synergistic work
in knowledge-processing research that could result in a new generation
of knowledge capture tools and techniques.
