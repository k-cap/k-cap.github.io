		<h3>Student Grants</h3>
		A limited number of grants are available towards the cost of registration,

		program. Those receiving grants are expected to help out with light duties at 
		the conference, such as registration and audio-visual setup. To apply, please 
		send email to kremer@cpsc.ucalgary.ca and blythe@isi.edu with your name, your 
		host institution, your advisor's name and email address, your papers at the 
		conference if any, and an estimate of your travel costs for the conference.
