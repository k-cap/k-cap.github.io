<H3 align="center">K-CAP 2005: Call for Workshop Proposals</H3>
<p>
The K-CAP 2005 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program for K-CAP 2005, to be held October 2-5 in Banff, Canada. Workshops will be held on Sunday, October 2, immediately before the main conference starts.
<p>
K-CAP workshops will provide an informal setting where workshop participants will have the opportunity to discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active exchange of ideas. Our aim for the workshop program is to promote and collect multidisciplinary research directions and potentially interesting technologies for efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources. Members from all research areas related to knowledge capture are invited to submit workshop proposals.
We particularly welcome workshops at discipline boundaries. 
<p>
To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, each workshop will be limited to 30 participants and ample time will be allotted for general discussion.
