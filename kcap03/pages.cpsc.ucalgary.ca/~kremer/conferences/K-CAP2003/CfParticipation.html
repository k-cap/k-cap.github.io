<div align="center">         Second International Conference on Knowledge Capture<br>
                        October 23-25, 2003<br>
                          Sanibel, Florida<br>

<p>Information in all forms is increasingly available, but using it effectively requires a range of technologies for representing, manipulating,
and reasoning with information. These technologies comprise Knowledge
Capture, the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse
sources of information. Driven by the demands for knowledge-based
applications, and the unprecedented availability of information on the
Internet, the study of knowledge capture has a renewed importance.</p>
<p>K-CAP 2003 will provide a forum in which to bring together disparate
research communities whose members are interested in efficiently
capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating
representations that can be useful for reasoning.<br>
<br>
