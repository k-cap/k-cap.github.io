<p>Information in all forms is increasingly available, but using it effectively
  requires a range of technologies for representing, manipulating, and reasoning
  with information.&nbsp; These technologies comprise <i>knowledge capture</i>,
  the extraction of useful knowledge from vast and diverse sources of information
  and raw data.&nbsp; Driven by the demands for knowledge-based applications,
  and the unprecedented availability of information on the Internet, the
study  of knowledge capture has a renewed importance. </p>
     
<p>Although there has been considerable work in the area of knowledge capture,
  activities have been distributed across several distinct research communities,
  principally knowledge engineering, machine learning, and natural-language
  processing. However, other fields study knowledge capture, too. For example,
  in planning and process management, mixed-initiative systems acquire knowledge
  about a user's goals by taking commands or accepting advice regarding a
task.&nbsp; In addition, recent research with the Semantic Web includes work
that tries to capture the knowledge associated with appropriately annotated
web pages.&nbsp; All of these approaches are related in that they acquire
information and organize it in knowledge structures that can be used for
reasoning. They are complementary in that they use different techniques and
approaches to capture different forms of knowledge. </p>
     
<p>K-CAP 2003 will provide a forum in which to bring together disparate research 
 communities whose members are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge 
 from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful 
 for reasoning. We solicit high-quality research papers for publication and 
 presentation at our conference. Our aim is to promote multidisciplinary research
 that could lead to a new generation of tools and methodologies for knowledge
 capture. </p>
     
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>

    <li> Knowledge acquisition tools</li>
     <li> Advice taking systems</li>
     <li> Authoring tools</li>
