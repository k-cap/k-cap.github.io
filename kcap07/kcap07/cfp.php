<h1>K-CAP 2007: Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>The Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Capture</h2>

<h2>28-31 October 2007, Whistler, BC</h2>

<h2>Website: <a href="index.html">http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/kcap07/</a></h2>


<h1><span style="color:#ff0033;">*Extended Deadline*</span></h1>
<p>
Due to the number of requests from authors, we have decided to extend
the deadline for paper submissions.  The new deadline is 
<span style="color:#ff0033;">Wednesday, May 9 at 11:59pm IDLW (UTC -12)</span>.
</p>

<p>
Information in all forms is increasingly available, but using it effectively requires a range of technologies for acquiring and 
representing that information. These technologies constitute knowledge capture, and involve the extraction of useful knowledge from 
vast and diverse sources of information as well as its acquisition directly from users. Driven by the demands for knowledge-based 
applications and the unprecedented availability of information on the Internet, the study of knowledge capture has a renewed 
importance.
</p>

<p>
Although there has been considerable work in the area of knowledge capture, activities have been distributed across several distinct research communities, including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, and the Semantic Web community. K-CAP 2007 will provide a forum that brings together disparate research communities such as these, whose members are interested in efficiently capturing knowledge from a variety of sources and in creating representations that can be useful for reasoning. We solicit high-quality research papers for publication and presentation at our conference. Our aim is to promote multidisciplinary research that could lead to a new generation of tools and methodologies for knowledge capture. K-CAP 2007 follows on the success of three previous conferences in 2005 (Banff, Canada), in 2003 (Florida, USA), and 2001 (Victoria, Canada).

</p>

<p>

The Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Capture, K-CAP 2007 will feature invited Talks, Technical Papers, Posters and Demos on a range of topics including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Knowledge Engineering &amp; modelling methodologies</li>
  <li> Knowledge Engineering &amp; the Semantic Web</li>
  <li> Mixed-initiative planning &amp; decision-support tools</li>
  <li> Acquisition of problem-solving knowledge</li>
  <li> Knowledge-based markup techniques</li>
  <li> Knowledge extraction systems</li>
  <li> Knowledge acquisition tools</li>
  <li> Advice taking systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Invited Speakers - Luis von Ahn and Oren Etzioni</h2>
<h3>About Luis von Ahn</h3>
	<p>
		Luis von Ahn is an assistant professor in the Computer Science
		Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where he also received
		his Ph.D. in 2005. Previously, Luis obtained a B.S. in mathematics
		from Duke University in 2000. He is the recipient of a MacArthur
		Fellowship, and was named one of Popular Science Magazine's &ldquo;Brilliant
		10&rdquo; scientists of 2006. His research interests include encouraging
		people to do work for free, as well as catching
		and thwarting cheaters in online environments.
	</p>
	  
	  <h3>About Oren Etzioni</h3>
	<p>
		Oren Etzioni is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of 
		Washington's Computer Science Department, and the founder and director 
		of the university's Turing Center.  He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie 
		Mellon in 1990, and his B.A. from Harvard in 1986.  Etzioni has authored
		 of over 100 technical papers on topics ranging from intelligent agents 
		 to data mining and Web search.  In 2005, he was awarded the IJCAI 
		 Distinguished Paper Award for "A Probabilistic Model of Redundancy in 
		 Information Extraction".  He received a National Young Investigator 
		 Award in 1993, and was chosen as a AAAI Fellow a decade later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Etzioni is the founder of three companies.  Most recently, he is the 
		founder of Farecast (www.farecast.com), a company that utilizes data 
		mining to inform consumers about the right time to buy their air tickets.

		  NPR, SCIENCE, The Economist, TIME Magazine, Business Week, Newsweek, 
		  Discover Magazine, Forbes Magazine, Wired, and elsewhere.
	</p>
	  
<h2>Technical Papers</h2>
Complete formatting instructions (including Microsoft Word and Latex templates) are available on the conference website. Briefly, submitted papers should be 8 pages, two columns, 10-point Times Roman (or equivalent), and &quot;US letter&quot; page-size. (Technical papers due 6 May 2007).
     
<h2>ABOUT THE VENUE</h2>
<p>
The conference will be held at The Fairmont Chateau Whistler (K-CAP 2007 
has negotiated a Conference rate). Whistler is on the west side of the 
Rocky Mountains, and is easily reachable from Vancouver in less than 2 
hours by road (&#126; 75 miles). Van services operate from Vancouver airport. 
Whistler is to be one of the sites of the 2010 Winter Olympics.
